Dino Game Real Jump

Overview

This is an Arduino-based implementation of the Chrome browser's Dinosaur Game, where real jump movements are detected to make the dinosaur jump.

Features

Real Jump Detection: Uses an accelerometer sensor to detect the user's jumping motion

Arduino Compatible: Works with various Arduino boards

Simple Controls: Play using only jump movements

Requirements

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

Accelerometer sensor (e.g., MPU6050)

OLED display (optional)

Jumper wires and breadboard

Installation and Setup

Install Arduino IDE.

Open the dino_game_real_jump.ino file in Arduino IDE.

Install necessary libraries (MPU6050, Adafruit GFX, etc.).

Connect the Arduino board to the PC and upload the code.

Connect the sensor to the board and test the jump detection.

How to Play

The user jumps, and the sensor detects the movement, making the dinosaur jump.

Obstacles appear at intervals, requiring precise jump timing.

The goal is to survive as long as possible.

The game runs in the Chrome browser.
